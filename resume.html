            <p>After checking out the ______ website, it looks like your company helps many Product Managers worldwide by saving time with manual data creation. Helping Product Managers and small businesses save time is great — and it’s definitely something I could get behind!</p>
            <p>I’ve been a designer for 10 years, and I’m currently looking to start a new journey with a fast-growing startup.</p>
            <p>I noticed that you’re looking for somebody with hands-on experience at a startup. At my current company (which was once a 5-person startup!), I’ve helped scale the design team and grow revenue with user-centered design.</p>
            <p>Here are a few accomplishments I’m proud of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Increased revenue by 50% after implementing a new onboarding system</li>
                <li>Grew our product’s user retention rate by 30% after leading an initiative to implement usability testing</li>
                <li>Pitched and implemented a new design tool, saving the company $20k a year while also increasing employee productivity</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Currently, I’m looking for a fast-growing startup that values entrepreneurial personalities and supports lifelong learning & development.</p>
            <p>Anyway, I’d love to chat further about this position!</p>
