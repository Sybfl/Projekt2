            <h1>Hi, my name is <br> Elis Salla</h1>
            <p>After checking out the  website, it looks like your company helps many Product Managers worldwide by saving time with manual data creation. Helping Product Managers and small businesses save time is great — and it’s definitely something I could get behind!</p>
            <p>I’ve been a designer for 10 years, and I’m currently looking to start a new journey with a fast-growing startup. I noticed that you’re looking for somebody with hands-on experience at a startup. At my current company (which was once a 5-person startup!), I’ve helped scale the design team and grow revenue with user-centered design.</p>
            <p>Here are a few accomplishments I’m proud of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Increased revenue by 50% after implementing a new onboarding system</li>
                <li>Grew our product’s user retention rate by 30% after leading an initiative to implement usability testing</li>
                <li>Pitched and implemented a new design tool, saving the company $20k a year while also increasing employee productivity</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Currently, I’m looking for a fast-growing startup that values entrepreneurial personalities and supports lifelong learning & development.</p>
            <p>Anyway, I’d love to chat further about this position!</p>
            <p>Thanks, <br> <strong>Elis Salla</strong><br> sallaelis4com <br> (355) 682188273</p>
